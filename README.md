This website is written in React JS. The GUI elements include a progress bar, a title, and a button to input files. When the website detects that a file has been selected by the user, it starts the upload to a firebase server.
The upload function continually updates the progress bar to show how much of the file has been uploaded. After the file is completed or an error is encountered, the website sends an alert telling the user what happened.
